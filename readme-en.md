If you are Django Girls Seoul Organizers, Coaches, Presentators, you must agree to [Django Girls Coach Manual](http://coach.djangogirls.org/)
* 설명하기 - 기술에 대한 어려운 용어의 사용을 하실 때는 실생활의 예를 들어 설명하고, 항상 전체적인 그림에 대하여 설명할 수 있도록 해 주세요. "쉬운건데" 라던가 "간단한데" 같은 표현을 사용하지 마세요.
* 난이도 조절하기 - 배우는 입장에서는 한 번도 해 본 적이 없는 가장 어려운 것일 수가 있습니다. 추가로 설명하고 있는 내용들이 가끔 불필요하며 난해하게 보일 수 있으니, 입문자들을 위해 적절한 난이도를 유지해주세요.
* 긍정적인 모습 보여주기 - 코딩은 재미있다는 것을 보여주세요. 프로그래밍은 무서운 것이 아니며, 도전적이지만 내가 성장하고, 누구나 할 수 있다는 것을 알려주세요.
* 참석자들에 대한 태도 - 참석자들이 발표 주제나 특정 내용을 모른다고 할 때 절대로 놀란 반응을 하지 마세요. 장고걸스에서는 (기술적인 것이든) `모른다`는 것은 이상한 것이 아니라 당연한 것입니다.
* 격려하기 - 마지막으로 세미나는 발표자, 운영자, 참석자 모두에게 유익하고 즐거운 시간이 되어야 합니다. 발표 이후에도 참석자들을 도와주고 그들의 성취를 격려해주세요.
